# basickernel
This is an extremely basic Multiboot complient "kernel." It still needs some fixes to it's PMM (physical memory manager,) after which system calls, FAT, and virtual memory work can commence. The latest feature is basic ATA-PIO support, with both read and write support. Reqiures an i686-elf-gcc toolchain, grub-pc-bin, nasm, and xorriso to build.
